<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    This processor connects to an RMI Listener and queries it for its list of MBeans.
    <code>service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://hostname:port//jmxrmi</code>
    Each MBean content will be packed into a JSON format and will be emitted as a Flowfile.
</p>
<p>
    The default behavior is to send every MBean content as a Flowfile which may be more
    data then is necessary.  The processor has the ability to use whitelist and blacklist
    values control what content becomes a Flowfile.
    If the values of these properties are empty then it implies whitelist everything and
    blacklist nothing.  To control the content you will need to provide the MBean Domain
    Name and optionally the MBean Type Name.  Multiple MBean Domain names can be provide
    by separating them with commas.  Within the domain MBean Type names are defined by
    using a colon and separating multiple types with spaces.
    <code>java.lang:MemoryPool MemoryManager,application.logger</code>
    The values can also handle regular expressions.
